	</h1>
	<!-- <h2>Here you can find a step-by-step tutorial on using RPS.</h2> -->

	<h2><a name="query">Query submission</a></h2>
	<p>
		The necessary input to the RPS is a linear pathway that is composed of compounds and reactions in KEGG
		format and connected by <b>-></b>.Such
		as:C00022->R00006->C00900->R03051->C04039->R01209->C00141->R01434->C00183，As shown in the figure
		below--<a href="../index.jsp">Recommend</a> page。
	<center><img src="../static/images/fig1.png" width="75%" alt="First View"></center>
	<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		This linear pathway can be designed by the user or searched by the linear pathway search algorithm
		provided in <a href="test.html">PathApi</a> page of our
		website, As shown in the figure below--<a href="../api_all.jsp">PathApi</a> page.
	</p>
	<center><img src="../static/images/fig2.png" width="75%" alt="First View"></center>
	<br>
	<p>
		For each search result of the algorithm, it can be copied directly to the clipboard (ensure that the
		browser supports this function),As shown in the figure
		below. Then you can return to the <a href="index.html">Recommend </a>page and paste it
		into the <b>Pathway is Composed of KEGG ID</b> input box for search.
	</p>
	<center><img src="../static/images/fig6.png" width="75%" alt="First View"></center>
	<p>
		In addition, the parameters of each part of the program operation can be adjusted by yourself in
		<b>Custom Weights</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Endogenous reactions ratio weights</b>：The higher the value
		of this item, the more likely a host organism with a higher score in the endogenous reaction section will be
		ranked in the top position.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>dead-end metabolites fraction weights</b>：A higher
		value of this term represents a stronger penalty for the occurrence of dead-end metabolites, which will
		reduce the ranking of host organism with such occurrences in the list of recommended host organism.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Competing endogenous reaction weights</b>：A higher
		value of this term indicates that the higher the pathway's competing endogenous reactions score in the
		host organism, the more likely the host organism is to appear in the top ranking.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="query">Recommended host organism ranking page</a></h2>
	<p>
		After the query is processed, you will see a list of host organism recommended according to the query pathway in
		the returned page, As shown in the figure below.
	</p>
	<center><img src="../static/images/fig3.png" width="75%" alt="First View"></center>
	<br>
	<p>
		Here, host organism rankings are sorted by score and can be selected by clicking on the drop-down list above
		the list to see a list of rankings under different quantities.In addition, by viewing the <b>VIEW</b>
		button at the end of each row of the list, you can view the details of the query pathway within that
		host organism, As shown in the figure below.
	</p>
	<center><img src="../static/images/fig4.png" width="75%" alt="First View"></center>
	<br>
	<p>
		On this page, there is an interactive component that shows the query pathway, and moving the mouse over the
		side of the reaction shows the name of the reaction, and similarly moving the mouse over the compound
		node shows the name of the compound and the structure diagram.
	</p>
	<p>
		This page also has a table describing the reaction information, showing the reaction id, formula and
		corresponding enzyme, which can be clicked to jump to the KEGG website for detailed
		information.Important is the fifth column- <b>Foreign Enzyme recommend</b>.
		If the reaction in this row is an endogenous reaction in the host organism, "<b>---</b>" is shown, and if it
		is an foreign reaction, there is a <b>RECOMMEND</b> button that, by clicking on it, opens a new page
		with recommendations for the appropriate foreign enzyme to express the reaction in the current
		host organism, the calculation results are shown in the following figure.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="query">Recommended Exogenous Enzyme Ranking Page</a></h2>
	<br>
	<center><img src="../static/images/fig5.png" width="75%" alt="First View"></center>
	<br>
	<p>
		This page recommends foreign enzymes from different host organism for expression in selected hosts. The
		<b>view</b> column of the table is appended with links to information on the available exogenous genes
		for subsequent pathway synthesis.
		<br>
		In the top     of the table, a drop-down list is provided to view the results of the recommended
		exogenous enzymes under the three ranking methods, with the default being combination.
